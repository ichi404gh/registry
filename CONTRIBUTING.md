# Welcome to Registry contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [stedi.com/registry/json-schemas](https://www.stedi.com/registry/json-schemas) :sparkles:.

In this guide you will get an overview on how to contribute schemas to the Stedi's Registry.

There are two ways to contribute schemas to the registry:

- By adding a _Provider_, which is a TypeScript program that can generate schemas in an automated, repeatable and consistent fashion by sourcing and unbunding them from another source (e.g. a hosted OpenAPI specification or a Postman collection)
- By adding schemas manually, if schemas cannot be extracted in an automated way (e.g. when the service is not exposing API definition in a machine-readable way).

### Adding a Provider

To add a new provider, please create a new file in the `src/providers` repository. The file name should be the provider name + `.ts` suffix. The file should contain a class implementing `BaseProvider` (or inheriting an other class that already implements `BaseProvider`).

A typical provider consists of few things:

- metadata - the `name`, `description`, `logoURL` and `versions` of the API
- `async getSchema(version: string): Promise<APISchema>` function - logic responsible for fetching spec from some URL
- `async unbundle(bundle: unknown): Promise<EntitySchema[]>` function - logic responsible for sanitization and breaking down the spec into multiple JSON Schemas.

Please see generic [OpenAPI Provider](https://github.com/Stedi/registry/blob/main/src/providers/openapi.ts) to see an example implementation of the `BaseProvider`.

#### OpenAPI-based Provider

If the API you want to add to the Registry exposes [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) or [Swagger](https://swagger.io) specification, you can use the following template to create a provider:

```ts
import { OpenAPIProvider } from "./openapi";

export class MyCompanyNewProvider extends OpenAPIProvider {
  constructor() {
    super({
      baseUrl: "https://docs.my-company.com/meta/v1/openapi.json",
      description: "My Company is a company...",
      docsLink: "https://docs.my-company.com/meta/v1/docs",
      logoUrl: "https://logo.clearbit.com/my-company.com",
      name: "MyCompany",
      versions: ["v1"],
    });
  }
}
```

After writing your provider, please also add it to the `src/providers/index.ts` file.

#### Postman-based Provider

If the API you want to add to the Registry exposes [Postman](https://www.postman.com) Collection, you can add it to the registry in two steps:

1. Import desired collection to the Stedi's ["registry" workspace](https://www.postman.com/stedi-inc/workspace/registry/overview) in Postman.
2. Use following template to create a provider:

```ts
import { PostmanProvider } from "./postman";

export class MyPostmanBasedProvider extends PostmanProvider {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "MyPostmanBasedProvider",
      description: "This company uses Postman",
      logoUrl: "https://logo.clearbit.com/postman.com",
      versions: ["1"],
      postmanCollectionId: "12143221-f27bc33f-082f-45f6-b143-cd3c7d4241da",
      docsLink: "https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop",
    });
  }
}
```

After writing your provider, please also add it to the `src/providers/index.ts` file. Please also make sure to have an environment variable `POSTMAN_API_KEY` set that has access to the Postman workspace.

#### Postprocessing

If the entities generated as a result of `unbundle` logic contain non-standard fields or formats not recognized by JSONSchema, you can supply a custom `sanitizeSchema(schema: unknown) => unknown` function to remove unwanted properties from the generated JSONSchemas.

If the entities generated as a result of `npm run generate` command contain non-standard fields or formats not recognized by JSON Schema, you can supply a custom `sanitizeSchema(schema: unknown) => unknown` function to remove unwanted properties from the generated JSON Schemas.

Sometimes the unbundled schema exports too many entities. Many of them may not be necessary from the registry's perspective - they can be virtual, meaningless or not providing any value. If that's the case, supply an optional `entities: string[]` array argument with the list of entity names that should be exclusively generated.

If a provider (e.g. FedEx, UPS) has multiple APIs, you can use `customPath` to specify where a generated schema is going to land in the registry.

#### Finalizing

Lastly, run `npm run generate` to generate the schemas. You can also run `npm run validate` to ensure that generated schemas are valid and will be accepted by [Mappings](https://www.stedi.com/products/mappings).

If the _validate_ task succeeds, you can commit your changes to branch or fork and create a pull request. We will review your pull request and if it's accepted, we will add your provider to the registry.

#### Best practices

- Try to keep the contributions scoped only to the Provider you're currently working on. If `npm run generate` results in changes introduced in other providers, please exclude them. To keep things simple, the drift should be addressed in a separate PR.
- Include only meaningful schemas. Providers can sometimes generate schemas that are not useful for the registry, they can provide minimal value, be empty or broken. Try to exclude them by passing custom `entities` parameter to the `BaseProvider` constructor.
- Leverage existing abstractions. If you want to add a provider that's based on OpenAPI or Postman, you can use existing providers as a base.
- Provide as much detail as possible. Do not remove important information from the schemas. Remove only the things that aren't passing validation.
- Prefer using OpenAPI providers over Postman providers. OpenAPI Providers provide more complete picture because its specification is JSONSchema-based while the Postman provider infers JSONSchema from examples. Moreover, Postman collections often lack response examples so using it produces only request schemas.
